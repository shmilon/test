# Error while pushing files to GitHub

When you tried to push your files to GitHub, you encountered the following error:

```
PS I:\APP Development\ANdroid Projects\Github repo\test> git push origin
To https://github.com/shmilon/test.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/shmilon/test.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

This error message indicates that the tip of your current branch in your local repository is behind the tip of the same branch in the remote repository (GitHub). To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have committed all your local changes using `git commit -am "Commit message"`.

2. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository using `git fetch origin`.

3. If you want to merge the remote changes immediately, use `git merge origin/main`. If you prefer to review the changes before merging, use `git log origin/main` to see the commit history on the remote branch.

4. If you decide to merge the changes immediately, run `git merge origin/main`. Resolve any conflicts if they arise.

5. Finally, push your local branch to the remote repository using `git push origin main`.

By following these steps, you should be able to integrate the remote changes and push your own changes to GitHub without encountering the error.
